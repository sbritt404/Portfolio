This is my first Responsive Web Portfolio that I finished on November 2,2023 @ 3:58pm.

I made it screen-reader accessable to the best of my abilities, and included as much accessability
that I had knowledge of at the time.
The design and aesthetic is very pastel and "cute." Not very professional, but I was just playing around
and having fun with the designing. For professional use I would remove the hearts, but keep everything else.
I can always experiment with different color schemes and layouts in the future since the structure is pretty basic.
I had a lot of fun making this portfolio. 

Thank You for taking a look! ‚ù§
